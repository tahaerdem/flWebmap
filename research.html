Now named as the Kahramanmaraş Earthquakes, largest since the 1939 Erzincan Earthquake of the same magnitude, is the second most powerful ever recorded in the region. Affecting 14 million people and leaving 1.5 million homeless across 11 provinces, it is now recognized as the deadliest natural disaster in the history of Turkey.</p>

The city, which has stood for millennia, has been flattened, leaving it almost unrecognizable. The extent of the destruction has driven nearly all residents away, transforming familiar streets and landmarks into a stark, altered landscape. In Kahramanmaraş, the historic district has been decimated, leaving once-vibrant neighborhoods in ruins. Similarly, Gaziantep, known for its rich history and architectural heritage, has seen extensive damage to its old city center, including the Gaziantep Castle—originally built by the Hittite Empire and later expanded by the Romans—and its traditional markets. Despite more than a year of reconstruction efforts, most of these cities remain unrecognizable to more than 500,000 people who once called them home.</p>

                    <p class="c-pg">Yet, Turkey is no stranger to such catastrophic earthquakes, as the country geographically sits on top two major fault zones - the North Anatolian fault zone being one of the most seismically active in the World. 20 years ago when a similarly destructive earthquake struck near Istanbul, the country’s economic and population center, it was a wake up call for the country: The government changed shortly after being deemed “incompetent,” much stricter building codes and regulations were put in place, nation-wide first response organizations were founded, and a new “earthquake tax” was introduced to help fund urban renewal and recovery efforts. The recent earthquakes exposed that many of these efforts have been immensely inadequate, mostly due to large-scale corrupt political, regulatory, and construction practices throughout the 20-year AKP rule. Moreover, the country’s most prominent scientists have been incessantly alarming against a long-awaited “Istanbul Earthquake” to strike in the next decade, with consequences exponentially graver.</p>

                    <p class="c-pg">This study aims to dissect these corrupt practices, identify their traces in the architectural level across an urban scale, and develop an alternative risk assessment mapping method that may offer critical insight for local authorities, municipalities, as well as individuals. Recent developments in interctive mapping techniques, artificial intelligence and machine learning have allowed large urban-scale risk assessment models to be implemented in order to detect possible structural defects before any failure or collapse. In this article, we will explain the structural malpractices that led to such destruction in the area, and will propose an automated, faster, and more scalable alternative “risk assessment method” that could be used to create an earthquake risk map of the bustling metropolis of Istanbul that is home to 16 million people.</p>

                    <p class="c-pg">Over the past century, seismologists have observed that the earthquakes have been occurring sequentially from east to west, with each major event triggering the next one further westward along the North Anatolian fault line. [1]</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p class="c-pg">This fault has experienced numerous devastating earthquakes, such as the 1939 Erzincan earthquake, which resulted in over 32,000 fatalities and more than 100,000 injuries. Since then, there have been seven additional M7.0+ earthquakes, most recent of these being the 7.6-magnitude Golcuk-Kocaeli earthquake in 1999, which occurred very close to Istanbul, causing over 17,100 deaths and displacing 250,000 people. [2]  This event has served as a catalyst for Turkey, shortly after brought with it widespread changes in the country's government, approach to disaster management, urban planning, construction codes, and public awareness about seismic risks.</p>
                    <p class="c-pg">The February 6 earthquakes raised significant concerns about the potential for a major seismic event near Istanbul. The East Anatolian Fault (EAF) that the sequence has occured directly neighbors the east-end of the North Anatolian Fault (NAF). Due to the close proximity of these fault lines, recent events may trigger tectonic activity in the neighboring fault by transferring stress from one to the other. Given the historical pattern of westward migration of major earthquakes along the NAF, seismologists believe that this westward progression is likely to continue, and the next major event could potentially occur near the city of Istanbul, posing an immense risk to the lives and infrastructure of this densely populated region.</p>

                    <p class="c-pg">The most recent major tectonic event along the North Anatolian Fault, the 1999 Izmit-Gölcük Earthquake, struck on August 17 at 3:01 AM local time. With a magnitude of 7.6 and an epicenter just 90 kilometers east of Istanbul, this 37-second tremor claimed over 17,000 lives and displaced 500,000 others. As Turkey’s most destructive earthquake until the February 2023 events, it exposed critical vulnerabilities in the country’s disaster preparedness.</p>
                    <p class="c-pg">The incumbent government’s organizational failure and inability to respond effectively, combined with a long-standing financial crisis, resulted in them receiving less than 10% of the vote in the 2002 elections. This paved the way for the rise of the AKP, still the ruling party since the elections.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p class="c-pg">Following the elections, the newly-elected AKP rapidly began working towards their key commitments. They made the “Earthquake Tax” permanent, a tax initially implemented in November 1999 under the Ecevit government to generate funds for disaster preparedness and relief efforts. While many of these taxes were later repealed in the following years, AKP government has ruled that the Special Communication Tax was to be made permanent and adjusted over the years, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic when it was increased from 7.5% to 10%. According to TUSIAD, the government has since collected more than 88 Billion Turkish liras between 2000-2022. </p>
                    <p class="c-pg">In addition to financial measures, another crucial promise was to enforce and expand stricter construction codes, particularly the 2001 Decree on Construction and Building Inspection, to ensure new buildings could withstand seismic activity, thereby reducing the risk of future catastrophes. This, along with multiple urban renewal projects aimed at replacing old vulnerable structures with more resilient ones in high density urban areas such as Istanbul, was meant to uplift the urban centers of the country to the next century. </p>
                    <p class="c-pg">Lastly, the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) was created in 2009, to coordinate and improve disaster management and civil protection nationwide. The country did not have a state-run emergency response organization prior to this, which marked a significant shift in Turkey’s disaster management approach, with now a heavy emphasis on pre-disaster planning and risk reduction.</p>

                    <p class="c-pg">Since the 2002 elections, the AKP has remained in power, largely due to initiatives that many believed had transformed Turkey from a run-down, old country to modern standards, with new highways, residences, and other infrastructure improvements. However, the February 6 earthquakes have led to widespread disillusionment. The devastation revealed that many of the government’s commitments were not fulfilled, exposing significant inadequacies and corruption in reconstruction and disaster preparedness efforts. </p>

These older structures, more than 625,000 of them, are particularly vulnerable, says Mehmet Özhaseki, Minister of Environment and Urbanism citing studies conducted by both the city and Ankara government. </p>

                    <p class="c-pg">Mayor Imamoglu shares numbers that raises another concern about the "When we took over the job (of mayorship of the megacity), the records of the previous management mentioned 40,000-50,000 risky structures. In the work we have conducted, we are estimating that there are as of now 90,000 structures that are severely damaged, i.e. have a risk of collapsing. Among them are workplaces and houses. We are aware that we have to move very fast...". February 6 earthquakes have exposed a widespread corruption and lax enforcement scheme, rendering virtually all past bookkeeping practices untrustworthy.</p>
                    <p class="c-pg">This, combined with an ever-increasing number of scientist warning against an potential earthquake to happen near Istanbul, meant almost every single building in Istanbul had to be structurally tested at an unprecedented scale and speed. </p>

                    <p class="c-pg">Since then, the Municipality has conducted various studies that tries to simulate the extent of damage (both buildings, people, and infrastructure) and shared it on its Open Data portal in the form a CSV document. The above map is an interactive visualization of this data, showing the number of damaged buildings, injuries, death toll, and shelter availability per neighborhood. This study allows us to have an overall idea by ZIP code, yet it lack the granularity of a high-resolution map at the building level - which is critical, as the extent of damage varies per structure dramatically.</p>
                    <p class="c-pg">To tackle this, the City has also launched a Rapid Scan program, that allows residents to opt in for a less in-depth yet faster structural scanning program. However, skyrocketing property prices prevent many from moving out, even if they fear their building is unsafe. Efforts by the municipality to assess earthquake resilience have met resistance, with 65% of residents refusing rapid scanning due to concerns over potential findings. Imamoglu adds: "Even with the fast scan program, many residents do not want to opt in simply because they cannot afford to relocate." Despite the political challenges, authorities have been able to kickstart several housing projects totaling up to an impressive 300,000 units. Yet even such high numbers cannot meet the ever-increasing need for affordable housing that's exacerbated by the recent earthquakes and an ongoing economic crisis.</p>

                    <p class="c-pg">The situation becomes even more dire as the wait time for structural testing can stretch up to 21 years at the current rate of 120 buildings per day. With the North Anatolian Fault indicating an imminent earthquake, local architects, engineers, and students have initiated alternative methods for identifying structural issues. Using makeshift lists of easily identifiable deficiencies, these grassroots movements on social media have become highly popular among the public with posts sparking conversations and sharing of information at the scale of millions in helping people make crucial  decisions involving their safety. This and many other initiatives has also shown that the solution to Istanbul's testing problem had to be more agile yet granular, and easily scalable.</p>

Similarly, low-income neighborhoods developed as “gecekondu”s (makeshift buildings constructed overnight by factory workers in the 1960s) are poorly documented, with many built before modern construction regulations. The contrast between well-established, high-income neighborhoods and these low-income areas is stark, with the lack of planning and open spaces visible even in satellite imagery.</p>

                    <p class="c-pg" style="margin-top: 50px;">The 1999 Earthquake was different in the way that it was widely studied and well documented. A detailed <a href="https://www.caee.ca/files/lesson-learned/kocaeli1.pdf">field investigation</a> conducted by <a href="https://www.istructe.org/get-involved/supported-organisations/eefit/">the Earthquake Engineering Field Investigation Team (EEFIT)</a> offers particularly useful insights here, highlighting that many structures collapse in a similar way, commonly referred as “pancake collapse”, that occurs in buildings with poor structural configurations, specifically those with soft stories. Nearly 24 years after regulatory amendments were introduced to eliminate these outdated construction practices, numerous photos and videos from the February 6 Earthquakes reveal that even newly constructed buildings collapsed due to the same malpractices these regulations were meant to address.</p>

                    <p class="c-pg">This building type, ubiquitous across the nation, is a mid-rise residential structure with street level retail and auxiliary spaces. The upper floors jut out beyond the building footprint to increases residential square footage—a tax loophole that lets real estate developers maximize profits.</p>
                    <p class="c-pg">In the first few seconds of the quake, the building appears stable, with only subtle signs of stress, such as the increasingly intense shaking of the glass shopfronts. Soon, however, the ground floor begins to buckle under the weight of the upper floors. The collapse initiates at this level, causing the ground floor to crumple and lose its support, marking the moment when the soft-floor failure becomes evident.</p>
                    <p class="c-pg">Once the ground floor gives way completely, the now-unsupported upper floors begin to collapse in a domino effect, with each floor pancaking onto the one below. In a matter of seconds, the building is reduced to a pile of debris and dust.</p>

                    <h2 class="title">Common Reasons Behind<br>Structural Failures in the Region</h2>
                    <hr class="title-line"/>
                    <p>Many videos and photos like the one above from the moment of collapse all hint at a common type of structural failure: First, the ground floor suddenly collapses, followed by all the floors above shortly after, pancaking on top of each other layer by layer in just a matter of seconds.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These “pancake collapses” are recognized as the primary cause of devastating consequences resulting from earthquakes in the region, such as the 1999 Golcuk earthquake, as reported by the infrastructure assessment team sent to the area. The factors leading to this phenomenon have been researched extensively and can be narrowed down to four primary construction/design shortcomings.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="title">1. Soft Story Buildings</h3>
                    <figure class="image-container-start" style="float:left; width: auto; margin-top:-20px; margin-bottom: -10px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
                        <img src="/flWebmap/resources/images/structural-diagrams/structural-diagram-02-soft-story.svg" style="float:left;" height="250px" alt="A soft story structure diagram">
                    </figure>
                    <p>Soft story buildings are multiple story buildings that has a ground floor that has large windows, wide openings, and large open commercial shopfronts where a shear wall or vertical support element would typically be needed to ensure that the structural stability. Especially in earthquake-prone areas such as Turkey, at least 30% of the ground floor area must be dedicated to structural elements to ensure that the structural system could withstand the stress of the above floors. Soft story buildings are highly common in the region, with many multi-story apartment buildings accommodate commercial floor space on the ground floor, which is allowed by mixed-used zoning practices. The 1999 quake has led to an updated building code that prohibited such structures, many developers did not feel pressed to follow the regulations due to the lack of a strictly enforced control mechanism.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="title">2. Heavy Overhangs</h3>
                    <figure class="image-container-start" style="float:right; width: auto; margin-top:-90px; margin-bottom: -10px;">
                        <img src="/flWebmap/resources/images/structural-diagrams/structural-diagram-03-heavy-overhang.svg" height="250px" alt="A building with heavy overhangs/protruding parts">
                    </figure>
                    <p>Another common practice is excessive cantilevering above the ground floor, as this allows developers to go beyond the site land usage limitations to maximize profits over extra square footage. Although cantilevering structures are a common practice in architectural design, combined with other malpractices such as soft story building designs, or using lower-quality building materials significantly increases the structural stress on the ground-level structural system. This may lead to a structural failure in the moment of an earthquake, even when the building may be able to withstand this load under normal conditions.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="title">3. Pounding Effect</h3>
                    <figure class="image-container-start" style="float:left; width: auto; margin-top:-20px; margin-bottom: -10px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
                        <img src="/flWebmap/resources/images/structural-diagrams/structural-diagram-04-misaligned-floor-slabs.svg" height="250px" alt="A building with heavy overhangs/protruding parts">
                    </figure>
                    <p class="c-pg">Pounding effect is a common cause of collisions between adjacent structures during seismic events due to insufficient gaps between buildings that share one or more walls. In fact, pounding effect accounted for over 40 percent of all structural failures, with at least 15 percent collapsing mainly due to this phenomenon. Similarly, 200 out of 500 surveyed structures after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake were damaged due to the pounding forces of adjacent buildings.</p>
                    <p class="c-pg">Although Turkish construction codes have clear guidelines for proper seismic gaps, this remains a widespread issue in many metropolitan areas worldwide due to financial and architectural constraints. In metropolitan cities, the gap is often narrow or nonexistent. For instance, statistics from Eskisehir, Turkey, show that only 36 percent of adjacent buildings are adequately separated.</p>
                    <p class="c-pg">In addition to seismic gaps, studies show that the distance between floor levels, floor slab misalignments, and mass differences between adjacent buildings contribute to the extent of damage.</p>
                    <h3 class="title">4. Short Columns, Misaligned Sturctural Elements and Other Post-Construction Alterations</h3>
                    <figure class="image-container-start" style="float:right; width: auto; margin-top:-60px; margin-bottom: -10px;">
                        <img src="/flWebmap/resources/images/structural-diagrams/structural-diagram-05-cut-column.svg" height="250px" alt="A building with heavy overhangs/protruding parts">
                    </figure>
                    <p>Structural alterations such as removing vertical supporting elements on the ground floor to open up space for commercial activities is another common practice many building owners employ to maximize profitability. Although there are multiple laws and regulations strictly prohibiting this, many buildings that has such alterations go unnoticed as it’s mostly done in the inside of the buildings.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="title">5. Usage of Prohibited Materials and Techniques</h3>
                    <figure class="image-container-start" style="float:left; width: auto; margin-top:-30px">
                        <img src="/flWebmap/resources/images/structural-diagrams/structural-diagram-06-sea-salt-cement.svg" height="250px" alt="Sea sand mixed cement">
                    </figure>

                    <p>The 1999 Earthquake has shown that the usage of certain construction materials, such as “sea-sand mixed cement” or rebars with no ribs, can be a significant risk factor during a earthquake. Although most of these materials cannot be identified without a structural test, some easy-to-spot visual hints can offer useful information. Many locals are advised to look for sea shells on the surface of the concrete to identify whether the cement is mixed with sea-sand.</p>

                        <p class="callout">"I come from the kitchen" in this business, as we say, meaning all my family, under my father, were also a part of this sector, the construction sector. I grew up working with him, witnessing all of the development at that time.

                            70 percent of all the settlements in Istanbul, I would say, are vulnerable to a major earthquake. Without the proper diagnosis treating a patient is not possible. The construction materials used for various settlements in different parts of Istanbul used to be of poor quality - I personally know this myself, as I was one of those who extracted, sold, and used this type of cement.</p>

                    <p class="c-pg">Patterns that allow an architect or an engineer to make an “educated guess,” could very well be detected by multi-modal image processing algorithms. We now have an ever-increasing amount of data about our cities, be it live bus schedules, maps with live-traffic feed, or panoramic images of virtually every street in any given city. This data —that we all are harnessing today, through tools like Google StreetView— combined with the recent advancements in AI and computer vision algorithms, allow us to make sense of the built environment in various new ways and combinations, at exponentially larger scales, much faster, and by using very few resources. </p>

In order to automate this, we developed a custom python script in QGIS that enabled us to query a Google StreetView image that showed only the adjacent buildings sharing a wall using the StreetView Static API. Once this was done, we rectified these images to mitigate any image-segmentation or calculation issues that might have occurred due to varying perspective levels in the StreetView imagery.</p>

                <p class="c-pg">These rectified street images then had to be intelligently segmented by left and right buildings, as well as windows within each facade. To solve this, we developed a custom Geospatial AI workflow that builds on the Grounding DINO and Segment Anything models. (Both available publicly on HuggingFace and Meta AI) Combining these two models enables us to semantically process any given object (e.g. buildings, sidewalk, cars, or windows, doors, and walls) across Istanbul’s street imagery. For this study, we have further tuned this workflow to detect and calculate misalignments in adjacent buildings — which is one of five aforementioned visual cues that may hint at a critical structural deficiencies.</p>

Then, we created subgroups for vertical and horizontal arrays of windows, which allowed us to create an index of facade elements (such as making calculations using only a select group of windows by floors or bays) — which then further enabled us to measure distances from either side of the adjacency line, and compare those with the other side. This way we were able to generate an adjacency score — an integer value of the length difference between corresponding floor slabs of the left and right buildings.</p>

                    <p class="c-pg">This experiment serves as a proof-of-concept for using zero-shot text-to-mask segmentation in conjunction with raster and geospatial data. For the scope of this study, we utilized a zero-shot image segmentation model. Consequently, we neither generated nor trained our model on any specific set of images or datasets. However, Meta AI Research indicates that the SAM image dataset SA-1B was trained using over 11 million images, with Turkey being prominently represented in the geographic distribution, contributing over 300,000 images to the dataset.</p>
                    <p class="c-pg">We evaluated the accuracy of zero-shot prompt-based image segmentation for estimating floor-misalignment-related pounding effect in adjacent buildings, across a series of metrics encompassing various processes applied during score generation, on a randomly-selected test group of buildings located in our pilot ZIP code, 34188. In order to achieve this, we compared machine-generated image segmentation results and floor misalignment scores with human-evaluated results across the same images in three distinct ways:</p>
                    <p class="c-pg">
                        1.	Annotators rated floor misalignment levels from A (perfectly aligned) to F (completely misaligned).<br/>
                        2.	Annotators compared AI-generated results with corresponding human evaluations.<br/>
                        3.	If an issue was found in the post-processed image or score, annotators specified the error based on a comprehensive list of points of failure, ranging from object obstruction to facade misindexing.

                    <p class="c-pg">After delving into the history of earthquakes in Turkey, examining corrupt construction practices, and exploring how AI can extract information from street view images, we present the culmination of this research: an interactive map.</p>
                    <p class="c-pg">This interactive map, the product of a year-long effort at the Center for Spatial Research, allows residents to access critical structural information about their buildings through a simple search interface. The map provides risk insights in a transparent, immersive, and easy-to-digest manner, embodying our commitment to accessibility and user-friendliness.</p>
                    <p class="c-pg">Initially available for Hurriyet Mahallesi, a densely packed pilot neighborhood with buildings constructed mostly before the 1999 Earthquake, the map offers risk insights on “misaligned floor calculations.” This area, with minimal open spaces or greenery, is notably highlighted in the IMM Earthquake Risk Simulation dataset for its high projected damage and death tolls.</p>
                    <p class="c-pg">Currently, the map covers selected ZIP codes, but it will gradually expand to encompass all boroughs and ZIP codes across Istanbul. This expansion will increase the number of tests performed and the data used to calculate the overall risk score for each building, ensuring more comprehensive coverage over time.</p>
                    <p class="c-pg">To use the map, residents can search for building names, door numbers, addresses, and more, limited to the available ZIP codes for now. By hovering over each building, users can access an in-depth risk report and a visual representation of the performed tests. This interface allows anyone to look up their address and access “machine-generated” structural insights.</p>
                    <p class="c-pg">Transparency is vital when dealing with AI-generated data, especially since much of it results from “blackbox” processes beyond our control. In developing this project, we made sure all computations made on the initial images were visible, explainable, and shareable. We clarified our aims with each computation and used language that encouraged users to critically assess every AI-generated result. This approach ensured that these “risk insights” were understood as fallible and provided citizens with our “training methods,” helping them recognize structural cues in their environments.</p>
                    <p class="c-pg">We hope this tool will serve as an insightful resource, helping residents understand the structural integrity of their buildings and prompting necessary actions to enhance safety. By making critical information accessible and transparent, we aim to empower residents to engage with their built environment and take informed steps toward improving their safety and resilience.</p>
